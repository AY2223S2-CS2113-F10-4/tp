## Overview
Duke of Books is a CLI library management system targetting NUS computer science (CS) students who wish to borrow and read CS related books. CS students are incredibly busy and hence having a command line interface (CLI) program without GUI makes finding the books they want quick and efficient. This software will also help them track loans and return dates.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **Top Module Classes:** [#31](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-4/tp/pull/31)
  - I implemented the foundation of the top module classes, which includes the `Main`, `Parser` and `TextUi` classes.

- **Feature:** Payment function for overdue loans [#123](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-4/tp/pull/123)

  - I implemented the payment function which will prompt the user to pay for overdue loans when they attempt to return the borrowed items. Failure to do so will result in returning action unsuccessful.

- **Feature:** Check item availability [#125](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-4/tp/pull/125)
  - I implemented this feature to allow users to check whether the item is available for borrowing prior to performing the borrowing action.
  - This feature is eventually removed as it overlaps with the feature in [#127](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-4/tp/pull/127).

- **Feature:** Check borrowing status of books [#127](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-4/tp/pull/127)
  - I implemented this feature to allow users to check the borrowing status of their loans, which will return the item details and the due date.
