## Overview
DukeOfBooks is a library Java Command Line Interface (CLI) for NUS Computing students who wish to borrow and read related computing books. Students are able to borrow and return books, along with other functionalities such as listing all books in the library and viewing previous loans.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Code Contributed: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=raydent30&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

#### Enhancements Implemented:
* New feature: Added the ability to read and write book data.
  * What it does: Allows the program to read a .txt file containing information on books that are in the library and save them in the program.
  * Justification: This feature significantly improves the product because it allows the addition and deletion of books from the library, requiring a database to store book data.
  * Highlights: 
    * This enhancement enables all changes to the book data to be saved, including the addition, removal, and modification of books, playing a crucial role.
    * Compiled and added 10 different popular books related to computer science of various topics into the book database.
* New feature: Added the ability for users to list books in the library.
  * What it does: Allows the user to list all the books in the library. The program informs the user if there are no books in the library.
  * Justification: This feature enables the user to have a glimpse of the types of books available, such as the topics of books. This is important as a new user might be clueless about the various topics of books available.
  * Highlights: This enhancement utilizes the `ListController` class, which I have also written, to obtain the correct information available in the library.
* New feature: Added the ability for users to check their previously borrowed books.
  * What it does: Allows the user to check their previously borrowed books.
  * Justification: This feature enables the user to refer back to the books they have already read. This is important because it allows users to keep track of their reading history and easily find books they enjoyed.
  * Highlights: Contributed to JUnit tests for the `BorrowHistory` class.

#### Contributions to the User Guide:
* Quality-checked the User Guide to ensure accuracy and clarity for users. 
* Edited the English and logic in the guide to enhance its readability. 
* Contributed to making the User Guide a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for our users.

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide:
* Quality-checked the Developer Guide to ensure accuracy and clarity for users.
* Edited the English and logic in the guide to enhance its readability.
* Contributed to making the Developer Guide a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for our users.

#### Contributions to Team-Based tasks:
* Ensuring GitHub's Java Continuous Integration (CI) checks set up by GitHub are passing. These checks help ensure that the code in the repository is up-to-date and meets the quality standards set by the team.
* Ensure JUnit test code is well written and has consistent format as writing well-designed test cases is an important part of software development.
* Check code for bugs and help resolve them, for instance the bugs in `SearchCommand` and `SearchController` and when reading and writing user profiles into the .txt database. By identifying and fixing bugs in the codebase, the stability and functionality of the project is improved.
* Helped review and merge pull requests from teammates, ensuring that the codebase remained high-quality and up-to-date.
