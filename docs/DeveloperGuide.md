## Design & Implementation
<img src="images/architecture.png"/>

**Access commands** related to accounts are fetched by the `getUserCommand()` method in the *TextUi* class.
These commands are parsed by the `parseAccessCommand()` method in the *AccessCommandParser* class, 
which is then parsed to the respective command classes responsible for executing the relevant features.

Upon execution, access commands return an AccessResponse object containing a User object and a message.
If a log in or sign up is unsuccessful, the User object will be null. If successful, the AccessResponse will 
contain the signed-in User object. The accompanying message will display a relevant message to the user.

Regardless of whether the password is successfully changed, the command will return a null User object. 
However, the message will vary depending on the result.

User data is stored in a HashMap mapping unique usernames to *User* objects, which store personal information 
as well as the username and the hashed password. Passwords are not explicitly stored for security reasons.

Users can only execute user commands, such as checking their borrowing history or borrow books, 
after successfully logging into the system. They must log out before exiting the application.

### Log in
<img src="images/login_sequence.png"/>  

Description: Log in to the account using saved username and password.

Format: `login -username USERNAME -password PASSWORD`  

Example: 
- `login -username me -password mypassword`  

When a user successfully logs into their account using their saved username and password, the application 
will display a welcome message and allow the user to execute user commands such as borrowing and 
returning books. The application only allows for an exact match.

If the user is unable to log in, the application will wait for the next access command (either login or signup).

### Sign up
Description: To use the system, users who do not have an account need to sign up with 
a unique username, a password, and a name. The username and password can only contain 
letters and numbers, but the name can contain spaces.

Format: `signup -username USERNAME -password PASSWORD -NAME FULL_NAME`

Example:
- `signup -username me -password apassword -name my name`

If the username entered by the user is unique in the database and the password is valid, the account creation process 
will be successful. However, if the username is already present in the database or the username/password 
contains invalid characters such as '$' or '^', the signing up process will be unsuccessful.

### Change Password
Description: Existing users can change their passwords by providing their username, 
old password and new password.

Format: `password -username USERNAME -old OLD_PASSWORD -new NEW_PASSWORD`

Examples:
- `password -username joe123 -old 123456 -new 654321`

The password changing is successful only if the username exist in the database, the old password matches with the 
corresponding username, and new password is considered valid (i.e., it does not contain invalid characters).


## Design & Implementation for Users Commands
All user commands will be fetched by the `getUserCommand()` method in the *TextUi* class. 
The `parseCommand()` method in the *Parser* class will then parse the command and pass it 
to the respective command classes. The command classes will be responsible for executing 
the relevant features of the application.


### Search book by title
Description: Searches for a book using its title.  
Format: `search -title TITLE`  
Example:  
- `search -title Python Programming`  

Successful searches will result in the program outputting the relevant book details, including ISBN, 
title, author, and topic. If the search is unsuccessful, the program will output a message indicating 
that there is no match in the inventory for the input title. 

### Search book by topic
<img src="images/search class diagram.png"/> 

Description: Searches for a book by its topic.  
Format: `search -topic TOPIC`  
Example:
- `search -topic Business`  

Successful searches will result in the program outputting the relevant book details, including ISBN,
title, author, and topic. If the search is unsuccessful, the program will output a message indicating
that there is no match in the inventory for the input title.


### Check book availability
Description: Check if a book is available for borrowing.  
Format: `check -title TITLE`  
Example:
- `check -title Python Programming`  

The program will check whether the book is available for borrowing and return the 
borrowing status (borrowed or not borrowed). It will also handle the case where the book 
does not exist in the inventory.


### Borrow book
Description: Borrow a book from the library.  
Format: `borrow -title TITLE`  
Example:
- `borrow -title Python Programming`  

For successful borrowing, the program will output a message indicating that the 
action was successful and mark the book as borrowed in the system. For unsuccessful 
borrow requests, the program will either output a message stating that there is no such 
book in the inventory, or a message indicating that the book is already on loan at the 
time of the borrow request.


### Renew borrow period of book
<img src="images/renew class diagram.png"/>  

Description: Renew borrowing of books for a fixed duration.  
Format: `renew -title TITLE`  
Example:
- `renew -title C++Primer`  

For successful renewal of books, the program will output a string showing that the action is successful
and also change the due period of borrow in the system. The program will handle error cases such as incorrect 
titles provided or books not available for renewal.


### Check borrowing status
<img src="images/check class diagram.png"/> 

Description: Check status of borrowed book.  
Format: `status -title TITLE`  
Example:
- `status -title C++Primer`  

The program will output the details of the relevant book being borrowed and also show the due date of the loan. 
The program will handle cases where there is no such book in the borrow history.


### Return book
Description: Return a book to the library.  
Format: `return -title TITLE`  
Example:
- `return -title C++Primer`  

The program should output a success message upon successful book returns and mark the book as available 
for borrowing by other users in the system. It also handles cases of incorrect title inputs or 
unsuccessful returns.


### Add book  
<img src="images/inventory class diagram.png"/>  

Description: Add new books into the system. 
Format: `librarian -title TITLE -topic TOPIC -author AUTHOR -isbn ISBN -action add`  
Example:
- `librarian -title C++Primer -topic Programming -author James -isbn 12345 -action add`  

This feature is only applicable for the admin. Upon successful addition of a new book, the program will output 
a message to inform the librarian. The new book will also be added to the inventory of the system, allowing users 
to borrow the book from the library. Error inputs and missing inputs will be handled accordingly.


### Delete book
Description: Remove books from the system.  
Format: `librarian -title TITLE -topic TOPIC -author AUTHOR -isbn ISBN -action delete`  
Example:
- `librarian -title C++Primer -topic Programming -author James -isbn 12345 -action delete`  

This feature is only applicable for the admin. For successful deletion of a book, the program will output a 
message to inform the librarian. The book will also be removed from the inventory of the system so that it will 
not be borrowable by users anymore. Error inputs and missing inputs will be handled accordingly.


### List book
<img src="images/list class diagram.png"/> 

Description: List all the books in the library.
Format: `list`  
Example:
- `list`  

The program will list out all the books in the library inventory. If the inventory is empty, the program 
will output a message indicating that there is currently no book in the library system.


### View history
Description: The program includes a feature to check the borrow history of books, which has two versions - 
admin and user. The admin version permits the administrator to access the entire borrow history, while the user 
version only permits the user to view their own borrow history.  
Format: `history`  
Example:
- `history`  

The program will output the borrow history of books according to the accessibility mentioned in the 
description above. The output will include the book title and other book details, the status of the book 
(whether it is available for borrowing or has been borrowed), and details of the loan, which will include the 
date and time of borrowing and returning.


### Make payment
Description: Make payment for overdue loans.  
When returning item(s) that are overdue, the user will be prompted to make a payment. 
Failure to do so will result in the returning action being unsuccessful.

Example:
```text
|| Enter command: return -title Introduction to Algorithms
|| Payment method:
|| 1.PayNow
|| 2.Debit/Credit card
|| 3.NETS
|| 4.Cash
|| 5.Cancel Payment
2
|| Payment Successful! Transaction ID: 978-0262033848202304090809
|| Item has been returned!
```

## Product Scope
### Target user profile

This program is designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science (CS)
students who wish to borrow and read CS related books.

### Value proposition

CS students are often busy, so a command line interface (CLI) program without a GUI can make
finding the books they need quick and efficient. This software can also help them keep track
of loans and return dates.
