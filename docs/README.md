# Duke of Books

Duke of Books is a CLI library management system targetting NUS computer science (CS) students who wish to borrow and read CS related books. CS students are incredibly busy and hence having a command line interface (CLI) program without GUI makes finding the books they want quick and efficient. This software will also help them track loans and return dates.
